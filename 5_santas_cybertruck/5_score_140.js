/*
Santa ðŸŽ… is testing his new electric sled, the CyberReindeer, on a North Pole road.
The road is represented by a string of characters, where:

. = Road
S = Santa's Sled
* = Open barrier
| = Closed barrier
Example of a road: S...|....|.....

Each unit of time, the sled moves one position to the right. If it encounters a closed
barrier, it stops until the barrier opens. If it is open, it goes through directly.

All barriers start closed, but after 5 units of time, they all open forever.

Create a function that simulates the sled's movement for a given time and returns an
array of strings representing the state of the road at each unit of time:

The result is an array where each element shows the road at each unit of time.
Take into account that if the sled is in the same position as a barrier, 
then it takes its place in the array.
The elves were inspired by this Code Wars challenge.
